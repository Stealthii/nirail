#NI Rail for Android

This is app is the product of 3 months work by Michael Allen (@michaeldfallen) and Richard Curry (@kurru) during our final year of University. 

Since then I have kept the timetables up-to-date and pushed bug fixes when I can but recently, I've been too busy and so I haven't had the time to update the app. 

I've heard nothing but great things from everyone who uses NI Rail and I know that people rely on the app. They deserve to have a better experience than I have time to provide.

With that I have decided to open the source to anyone to use. I know the code quality is pretty poor and the design is well behind the current standard expected of an Android app so It's pretty embarassing but I feel this is the best way to respect my users. Hopefully someone can fork it, fix it, and open a pull request, I would be happy to publish any contributions.

Place a debug keystore and a Google API key in the folder keys.

The app doesn't come packaged with a timetable db, run the TimetableDownloader app to create one.

My evil iPhone competitor/sister app :-P
Awesome app, well worth a look for anyone with an iPhone. You took the weight off everytime someone asked if I would port NIRail to iPhone and I could point them straight to you.
